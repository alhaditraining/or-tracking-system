Product Definition Report (PDR) – Version 3
(Baseline Update)
OR, OPS & BS Budget Tracking System
For Sub-Contractor Operations
Update Note: This version includes optional safety fields for LM completion and invoice payment
tracking.
1. System Overview
This system is designed to organize and control the operational and invoicing workflow between a
sub-contractor and beneficiary companies. It ensures clear budget separation, proper invoicing,
attachment control, reporting, and long-term archiving.
2. Scope & User Roles
- Single sub-contractor company (internal use only)
- English interface only
- User Roles:
• Admin: Full access to all modules and data entry
• Viewer: Read-only access to dashboards and reports
3. End-to-End System Workflow
Step 1 – Login
Users log in using secure credentials based on their role.
Step 2 – Home Dashboard
Overview of all ORs, OPS & BS budgets, consumed amounts, remaining balances, and alerts.
Step 3 – OR Creation
Admin creates ORs for each budget under the same contract context.
Step 4 – OR Numbering Rule
Each budget has a separate OR number:
• OPS Budget → OR Number (OPS)
• BS Budget → OR Number (BS)
This enables independent tracking per department under the same agreement.
Step 5 – Requests (LM)
Operational requests are entered under their respective OR number (OPS or BS).
Step 6 – Invoicing
Requests are grouped into invoices under the same OR number. Each invoice must include:
• Delivery Note
• Invoice Image
Step 7 – Stationery Invoices
Independent invoices recorded outside OR scope, with mandatory attachments.
Step 8 – Reporting & Archiving
All ORs, requests, and invoices are reported and archived for audit and reference.
4. Optional Safety Fields (Baseline Additions)
4.1 Requests (LM) Status
Each LM Request may include optional fields for safety and operational tracking:
- IsCompleted (Yes/No)
- IsCancelled (Yes/No)
These fields are optional and do not change the agreed OR and invoicing rules.
4.2 Invoice Payment Tracking
Each invoice may include optional payment tracking fields:
- IsPaid (Yes/No)
- PaidDate (Date, if paid)
These fields are optional and intended for reporting and follow-up only.
